# AWS Lambda Serverless Computing Workshop

## üöÄ Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a hands-on workshop on AWS Lambda and serverless computing. The notebook covers basic concepts, practical examples, and integration with other AWS services.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, IAM roles, and API Gateway.
2. Python 3.8 or later installed on your local machine.
3. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-lambda-workshop.git
cd aws-lambda-workshop

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Required Packages**
pip install jupyter boto3 matplotlib

4. **Configure AWS Credentials**
- Create an IAM user in your AWS account with programmatic access and appropriate permissions.
- Set up your AWS credentials using one of these methods:
  a. Create or edit `~/.aws/credentials` file:
     ```
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
     aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     ```
  b. Set environment variables:
     ```
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-preferred-region
     ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
jupyter notebook

6. **Open the Workshop Notebook**
- In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open `AWS_Lambda_Workshop.ipynb`.

## üìò Running the Notebook

1. Read through each section carefully.
2. Execute code cells in order by pressing Shift+Enter or using the "Run" button.
3. Replace placeholder values (like `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` and `YOUR_LAMBDA_ROLE`) with your actual AWS resource identifiers.
4. Some cells create AWS resources. Ensure you understand the actions before running them.
5. Pay attention to the cleanup section at the end to avoid unnecessary AWS charges.

## üîë Important Notes

- The notebook uses boto3 to interact with AWS services. Ensure your IAM user has the necessary permissions.
- Some operations may incur AWS charges. Monitor your AWS Billing dashboard.
- The provided Lambda function is a basic example. Modify it for your specific use cases.
- Always follow AWS best practices for security, especially when handling credentials.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission errors, verify your IAM user has the correct policies attached.
- For `botocore` exceptions, check your AWS credentials setup and internet connection.
- Ensure you're using a compatible Python version for both your local environment and Lambda functions.
